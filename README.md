## documents folder

Contains all of the related papers.

## sampleMatlabCodes folder

Contains several Matlab codes written for different lattices.

## Simple Square

The code can be found in the c++ folder!

On this folder the simplest Hofstadter's model on a square lattice is calculated by a c++ code.

 The introduction.pdf file on the documents shows some results as well as the labeling method. For more details on the calculation one can look at the first 2 pages of Cohen - Hofstadter's Butterfly.pdf in the documents folder. 

## Simple Hexagonal

The code can be found in the c++ folder!

Hofstadter's butterfly is calculated on a hexagonal lattice without considering any orbitals.

The introduction.pdf file on the documents shows some results as well as the labeling method.


## Mapping Square Lattice

The code can be found in the c++ folder!

For more information regarding the calculation one can look at [this paper](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.245113).
